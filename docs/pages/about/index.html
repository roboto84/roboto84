<h3>Why I Develop Software</h3>
<p>Software development may seem like a novel endeavor when taking into account the variety of professions
throughout human civilization, but in reality software development has roots in one of the oldest trades:
storytelling.  From telling the story of us through history, and the story of our resource
management with accounting, software development is just the latest iteration of storytelling, by telling
the story of data and what it means to us as a people.</p>
<h3>My Software Philosophy</h3>
<p>When it comes to creating software, my general sense is that it is much more of an art form akin to
traditional writing more than anything else.  Developers, programmers, and software engineers all
use math in the form of Boolean logic (along with well known patterns) to produce results, but it
is hard to ignore the similarities between a writer's creative/editing process and the similar process
that occurs when creating programs at different scales.  I try to think about that when I am creating
software. I keep the fundamentals in mind of course, but also the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What story is my software trying to tell?</strong> <em>Is the problem my software is trying to help solve well-defined?</em></li>
<li><strong>Is my software story worth telling?</strong> <em>Am I re-inventing the wheel? Does some lib already do it?</em></li>
<li><strong>Am I telling my software story in a concise and efficient way?</strong> <em>(design patterns, language features)</em></li>
<li><strong>Can my software story reach my audience?</strong> <em>(scaling considerations, platform choice, data management, network management)</em></li>
<li><strong>Have I made the most of my software storytelling tools?</strong> <em>(language features, editor automation, software libraries)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>How I Approach Software Problems</h3>
<p>Most problems in software are actually a collection of smaller problems that need to be solved.  Nowadays, software
developers have the privilege of leveraging decades worth of industry problem-solving.  This means that a subset of
problems I want to solve may already be solved, or have a large amount of literature on different approaches
to solving them.  Doing some research will likely solve 95% of my problems easily and quickly, saving my energy
for more novel issues.</p>
<span class="quote">
  "There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance." <span class="author">– Socrates</span>
</span>
<p>When I have a neoteric problem, it's important to do what I can to truly understand it before attempting to
solve it.  This saves time and resources in the long run.  The problem can be probed with the following initial questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the problem really need to be solved, or is my energy better spent elsewhere?</li>
<li>If it does need to be solved, how much time and resources do I have available to solve it?</li>
<li>What does the data domain look like?</li>
<li>What does the literature say about this type of data, if any?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the problem is probed, I can design a solution that focuses on efficiency, creativity, and flexibility.  It is
important to understand and accept that a solution can be impacted by the amount of time and resources allotted for it.
Fortunately, I believe that software problem-solving can be an iterative process in which &quot;finished is better than perfect&quot;
and perfection can be achieved give enough iterations.  The iteration investment is a decision that would have to be made
and balanced with other concerns.</p>
<h3>My Writings</h3>
<p>Writing is a way for me to log some of my life experiences.  Specifically those experiences that are procedural and
introspective.</p>
<span class="quote">
  "The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change." <span class="author">– Carl Rogers</span>
</span>
<p>I practice writing as a way to organize my thoughts and experiences.  Similarly to code documentation, writing
allows me to look back at things I have already done and consider how to do them again quickly, consider how to do
things better, and solidify my position for further research on a subject.</p>
<h3>Other Interests</h3>
<p>My interests usually revolve around making stuff.  They are heavily influenced by self-sufficiency
and sustainability.  I have hobbies that work around some of my life fundamentals and an ultimate goal I have set
for myself of running a modern self-sustaining homestead.</p>

</span>
<h4>My Hobbies Include</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hydroponics using chemical fertilizers and traditional gardening using worm compost and worm tea as fertilizers.</li>
<li>Soap making using lye and various oils as ingredients.</li>
<li>Food fermentation techniques such as tempeh, water/milk kefir, and ginger bugs for the small production of vinegar, alcohol and preserved foods.</li>
<li>Basic mycology using hardwoods, brown rice and other substrates for the growth of Lion's Mane and Pink/Blue Oyster mushrooms.</li>
<li>Essential oil distillation using dehydrated and fresh herbs such as German Chamomile, English Lavender, and lemon peels for the production of fragrant oils and hydrosols.</li>
<li>Studying weather/pollution patterns (centered around temperature, humidity, pressure and precipitation) using sensors and web data to gain better insight into my gardening techniques. Have a look at the <a href="https://apps.roboto84.dev/air">Roboto, Air</a> project or my <a href="/pages/projects/">projects</a> section.</li>
<li>Tinkering with sensor technology that has chatbot capabilities (IoT) in order to query and manage data. Check out the <a href="https://apps.roboto84.dev/wh00t">Roboto, wh00t</a> project.</li>
<li>I also enjoy running, nature hikes, and reading sci-fi books.  Check out my <a href="/pages/reading/">reading list</a>.</li>
